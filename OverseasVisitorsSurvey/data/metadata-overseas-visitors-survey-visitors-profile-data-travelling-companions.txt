  - 'The sample is selected based on a quarterly quota, which is set according to
    the actual visitor arrival statistics from the same quarter of the previous year.
    In addition, the data collected are weighted by country of residence, age group
    and length of stay, based on actual visitor arrival statistics compiled from the
    D/E cards. This ensures that the profile of visitors surveyed resembles the distribution
    of visitor arrivals in the total population.'
